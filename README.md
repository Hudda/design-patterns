# Design Patterns

Design patterns implemented in C#

## Strategy Pattern

Strategy defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorith vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one to many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and upated automatically.
