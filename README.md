# Design Patterns

Design patterns implemented in Typescript.

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.

## Decorator Pattern

Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects, called decorators.

## Factory Method Pattern

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete class.

## Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

## Singleton Pattern
