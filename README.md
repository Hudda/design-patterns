# Design Patterns

Design patterns implemented in C#

## Strategy Pattern

Strategy defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorith vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one to many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and upated automatically.

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating a families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
